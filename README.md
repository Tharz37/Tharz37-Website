Welcome to my personal portfolio (Unit: **THARZ_37**).
This site is built from scratch using raw **HTML5 & CSS3**—no frameworks, just pure engineering logic. The design follows a **"Mechanical Blueprint"** aesthetic, featuring telemetry data, grid layouts, and "Mission Logs" for my projects.

---

## 🧠 System Architecture

This portfolio serves as the central hub for my work as a **Robotics & Automation Engineering Student**. It is optimized for:

- ✅ **Professional Visibility:** Clean code, fast load times.
- ✅ **Blueprint UI:** Dark Navy theme with technical grid overlays.
- ✅ **Project Archiving:** Detailed "Mission Logs" for every engineering build.
- ✅ **SEO:** Integrated Google Analytics & Search Console.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🌑 **Dark Mode Native:** Designed with a custom navy/gold/red palette (`--rb-navy`).
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive:** Stacked layouts and scrollable telemetry strips for phones.
- 📂 **Project Mission Logs:** Individual HTML pages for deep-dives into projects.
- 🔗 **CAD Integration:** Direct links to Fusion 360 & GitHub repositories.
- 🚀 **Deployed:** Hosted live via **GitHub Pages**.
