# 🌐 Tharun's Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio — **built from scratch** using only **HTML** and **CSS** (and a lot of midnight brainwaves 😅). No frameworks, no builders — just code, creativity, and caffeine ☕.

## 🧠 About This Project

This portfolio website is a **central hub** for everything I do as a Robotics & Automation Engineering student.  
It reflects my skills in:

- ✅ CAD Design (Fusion 360, Solid Edge, Ansys)
- ✅ Embedded Systems (Arduino, ESP32)
- ✅ Python Programming
- ✅ Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS)
- ✅ AI Integration and Automation

The site is responsive, clean, and optimized for **professional visibility**, **GitHub Pages hosting**, and **Google Search indexing**.

## ✨ Features

- 🔥 Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, and desktop)
- 🌑 Dark-themed UI (because light mode is illegal here 😎)
- 📜 Embedded Google Drive certificate previews
- 📁 CAD models linked via Fusion 360 viewer
- 🖼️ Images & assets organized under `/assets/`
- 🚀 Deployed using **GitHub Pages**
- 📊 Google Analytics + Search Console integrated
