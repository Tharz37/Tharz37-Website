# 🌐 Tharun's Personal Portfolio



Welcome to my personal portfolio — **built from scratch** using only **HTML** and **CSS** (and a lot of midnight brainwaves 😅). No frameworks, no builders — just code, creativity, and caffeine ☕.

## 🧠 About This Project



This portfolio website is a **central hub** for everything I do as a Robotics & Automation Engineering student.  

It reflects my skills in:



- ✅ CAD Design (Fusion 360, Solid Edge, Ansys)

- ✅ Embedded Systems (Arduino, ESP32)

- ✅ Python Programming

- ✅ Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS)

- ✅ AI Integration and Automation



The site is responsive, clean, and optimized for **professional visibility**, **GitHub Pages hosting**, and **Google Search indexing**.

## ✨ Features



- 🔥 Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, and desktop)

- 🌑 Dark-themed UI (because light mode is illegal here 😎)

- 📜 Embedded Google Drive certificate previews

- 📁 CAD models linked via Fusion 360 viewer

- 🖼️ Images & assets organized under `/assests/`

- 🚀 Deployed using **GitHub Pages**

- 📊 Google Analytics + Search Console integrated
